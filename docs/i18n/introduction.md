This walkthrough is intended to go over the steps needed in order to implement support for new languages within Venngage's infograph project.

### [Getting Started](#getting-started)

- If they are stored in PHP files, please continue reading the [i18n with PHP](../i18n/php)
- If they are stored in Javascript files, please continue reading the [i18n with Javascript](../i18n/javascript)
