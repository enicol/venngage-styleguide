# Internationalization

## Introduction

--------
This walkthrough is intended to go over the steps taken in order to implement support for new languages within Venngage's infograph project.

- get the translations
- once you have them, you'll need to determine where in our app those translations will go, and what language they're written in
- the 2 options here are Javascript and PHP
- if the answer to the last step was PHP, please continue reading the [Translations in PHP](i18n/php)
